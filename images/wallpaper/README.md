## Background
Originally, I found a low resolution version of the wallpaper in monochrome and no idea who the original author was.

The image pictured here is my recreation. I made it so I could rescale and recolor the low resolution reference material. The format is SVG.

### Author
I have since found the original artist. Solaris and their work can be found [here](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/set-cubes-vector-icon-cube-logo-1715245105).
